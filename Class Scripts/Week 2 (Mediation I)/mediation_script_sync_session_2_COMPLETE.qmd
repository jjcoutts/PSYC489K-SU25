# Mediation

Mediation analysis allows us to discover *how X* causes *Y*, or in other
words, the *mechanism* by which *X* exerts its influence on *Y*.
Mathematically, mediation is quite simple and follows nicely from the
regression review from last week.

## Load required packages

You should load the jtools and ggplot2 packages.

```{r}
# be sure to also load PROCESS so it can be used later in this script
library(jtools) # for apa style plots
library(ggplot2) # for fancy plots

# to load in PROCESS....
source("~/PSYC489K-SU25/process_v5") # make sure this goes to the correct file path
```

## Read in and summarize the data

Our dataset today comes from a study on war veterans and their
development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) returning home from
deployment (Pitts et al., 2018). Combat is often a traumatic experience
for war vets, who can struggle with PTSD in the wake of re-entry into
society. It is critical for us to identify ways to improve the lives of
those of have given a part of theirs to protect us. The variables in
this dataset are:

-   ptsd: Self-reported PTSD symptomatology, higher scores = more PTSD
    (Range: -12.21, 70.52)

-   dep: Self-reported depression levels, higher scores = more
    depression (Range: -9.642, 23.315)

-   combat: Higher scores indicate more exposure to traumatic combat
    experiences (Range: -5.502, 26.033)

-   pthreat: Perceived threat to life and concerns about safety, higher
    scores = more threat (Range: 11.92, 72.98)

-   viewofd: Perceived benefits of deployment, higher score = more
    benefits (Range: 6.738, 38.779)

-   sociald: Social desirability, higher score = greater inclination to
    appear socially desirable (Range: 0.0471, 17.495)

Read in and summarize the data.

```{r}
warvet <- read.csv(file = "~/PSYC489K-SU25/Datasets/ptsd_vet.csv")
# now summarize the data
summary(warvet)
```

## Model Prep

Say we interested in determining whether traumatic experiences during
combat (COMBAT) increased PTSD (PTSD), at least in part because they
increased perceived threats to life (PTHREAT). Please write out the
conceptual diagram, statistical diagram, and model equations for this.

## Different Inferential Tests

For consistency, set the seed to 489 at the the bootstrap and Monte
Carlo sections to ensure we get the same results.

### The causal steps

What are the hypotheses we are testing (in terms of parameter\[s\])?

**Step 1 - Total effect significant**

H0: c = 0 (where *c* represents the population total effect of COMBAT on
PTSD)

H1: c != 0

**Step 2 - a path significant**

H0: a = 0

H1: a != 0

**Step 3 - b path significant**

H0: b = 0

H1: b != 0

**Step 4 - c' not significant**

Recall: According to Baron and Kenny, partial mediation if direct effect
is still significant. Complete mediation if non significant.

Test these by **fitting regression models to the data by yourself** (no
PROCESS).

```{r}
cpath <- lm(ptsd ~ combat, data = warvet); summary(cpath) # does x cause y
# c path significant, carry on
apath <- lm(pthreat ~ combat, data = warvet); summary(apath) # does x cause m
# a path significant, carry on
bcppath <- lm(ptsd ~ combat + pthreat, data = warvet); summary(bcppath) # does m cause y? is there any remaining effect of X after controlling for m?
# b path significant, c' too, so partial mediation
```

The nulls for hypotheses 1-3 were rejected, meaning that we can deem
perceived threat as a mediator of the relationship between traumatic
combat experiences and ptsd symptoms. Since the direct effect was still
significant, we can only claim partial mediation (according to the
causal steps).

### The joint test

What are the hypotheses we are testing (in terms of parameter\[s\])?

**Step 1 - a path sig**

H0: a = 0

H1: a != 0

**Step 2 - b path sig**

H0: b = 0

H1: b != 0

Alternatively, the null can be: H0: a = b = 0 vs. H1: a & b != 0

Test these by using PROCESS.

```{r}
process(data = warvet, x = "combat", m="pthreat", y = "ptsd", model = 4, boot=0) # boot = 0 will suppress the bootstrap output, which we don't want since we're using the joint test
# additionally, model 4 is for simple (and parallel) mediation models
```

Since *a* and *b* were both significant, we can deem perceived threat as
a mediator of the relationship between traumatic combat experiences and
ptsd.

### Sobel test

What are the hypotheses we are testing (in terms of parameter\[s\])?

H0: ab = 0

H1: ab != 0

Do this manually (i.e., by yourself) or using PROCESS.

```{r}
# manually...we need to pull the coefficients from the model objects and standard errors from the variance covariance matrix
apath <- lm(pthreat ~ combat, data = warvet)
a <- coef(apath)[2]
se_a <- sqrt(diag(vcov(apath)))[2]
bcppath <- lm(ptsd ~ combat + pthreat, data = warvet)
b <- coef(bcppath)[3]
se_b <- sqrt(diag(vcov(bcppath)))[3]
zstat <- a*b/sqrt(a^2*se_b^2+b^2*se_a^2+se_a^2*se_b^2)
unname(zstat)

# in PROCESS
process(data = warvet, x = "combat", m="pthreat", y = "ptsd", model = 4, boot=0, normal = 1) # normal = 1 will generate the Sobel test when used with a mediation model. Boot is still 0 because we don't want to generate bootstrap confidence intervals. 
```

### The bootstrap

What are the hypotheses we are testing (in terms of parameter\[s\])?

H0: ab = 0

H1: ab != 0

Do this manually (i.e., by yourself) or using PROCESS.

```{r}
# manually 
# set parameters of the bootstrap 
B = 5000 # number of resamples
n = nrow(warvet) # sample size
bs_res <- rep(NA, B) # empty vector to store results
set.seed(489) # seed to reproduce results 

# begin bootstrapping
for(i in 1:B){
  b_dat <- warvet[sample(1:n, n, replace = TRUE),] # creates resampled dataset
  boota <- coef(lm(pthreat ~ combat, data = b_dat))[2]
  bootb <- coef(lm(ptsd ~ combat + pthreat, data = b_dat))[3]
  bs_res[i] <- boota*bootb
}
# create bootstrap confidence intervals
bs_ci <- quantile(bs_res, c(.025, .975))
# show bootstrap CI
print(bs_ci)

# In PROCESS...
process(data = warvet, y = "ptsd", m = "pthreat", x = "combat", model = 4, seed = 489,progress=0) # seed will make the results reproducible, which is important because bootstrapping is otherwise a completely random process
# additionally, bootstrapping in PROCESS comes with a progress bar, which is cool but makes certain outputs wonky. I will add progress = 0 to all PROCESS commands in this class.
```

We reject the null that the indirect is zero and deem perceived threat a
mediator of the relationship between combat experiences and ptsd, 95%
percentile bootstrap CI = \[0.134, 0.409\]. We rejected the null because
the 95% confidence interval did not contain 0 and 95% of infinitely many
confidence intervals constructed the same way will contain the true
population mean.

### Monte Carlo

What are the hypotheses we are testing (in terms of parameter\[s\])?

Do this manually (i.e., by yourself) or using PROCESS.

```{r}
# set parameters 
MC = 5000 # number of resamples
set.seed(489) # make results reproducible

# manually 
mca <- rnorm(MC,a, se_a) # generate 5000 different a paths from a distribution based on our observed one
mcb <- rnorm(MC,b, se_b) # generate 5000 different b paths from a distribution based on our observed one

# create MC CI
mc_ci <- quantile(mca*mcb, c(.025, .975))
# show MC CI
print(mc_ci)

# In PROCESS... 
process(data = warvet, y = "ptsd", m = "pthreat", x = "combat", model = 4, mc = 1, seed = 489, total = 1)
# we add mc = 1 to generate monte carlo CIs
# additionally, total = 1 will print the results for the total effect model. 
```

We reject the null that the indirect is zero and deem perceived threat a
mediator of the relationship between combat experiences and PTSD, 95%
percentile Monte Carlo CI = \[0.146, 0.387\]. We rejected the null
because the 95% confidence interval did not contain 0 and 95% of
infinitely many confidence intervals constructed the same way will
contain the true population mean.

## Data Visualization

Let's visualize the *a* and *b* paths (note: the b path will not be the
true visualization, just do a simple scatterplot between x and y).
Generic code for a scatterplot in ggplot2 is below.

```{r}
# for the a path...
ggplot(data= warvet, aes(x = combat, y = pthreat)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  jtools::theme_apa()

# for the b path... (sort of; it's a simple regression plot from a multiple regression)
ggplot(data= warvet, aes(x = pthreat, y = ptsd)) +
  geom_point() + 
  jtools::theme_apa()
```

## Statistical Diagram

Complete our diagram from earlier with the information from the model.
Add the scatterplots above to make this ready for production.

I uploaded a complete version to ELMS.
